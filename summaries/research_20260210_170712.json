  "findings": "**Overview**\nThe paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for adaptation in agentic AI, which is a crucial mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization in AI systems. The authors propose a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations, providing a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for building more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.\n\n**Key Findings**\nThe key findings from the papers can be summarized as follows:\n* Agent adaptations can be categorized into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms, as discussed in the paper \"A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication\" [2203.08975v2].\n* Tool adaptations can be categorized into agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms, as mentioned in the paper \"AIRCC-Clim: a user-friendly tool for generating regional probabilistic climate change scenarios and risk measures\" [2111.01762v1].\n* A systematic framework for adaptation in agentic AI is proposed, which includes a cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework, as discussed in the paper \"A cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework\" [2510.01751v1].\n* The strengths and limitations of different adaptation strategies are discussed, including the exploration of Venus, as mentioned in the paper \"A New Strategy for the Exploration of Venus\" [2412.06830v1].\n* The key open challenges and future opportunities in agentic AI adaptation include building trustworthy AI systems, as discussed in the paper \"Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance\" [2511.16402v1].\n\n**Methodology Trends**\nThe common approaches and techniques used in the papers include:\n* Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, as discussed in the paper \"A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication\" [2203.08975v2].\n* Large language models, as mentioned in the paper \"Focus Agent: LLM-Powered Virtual Focus Group\" [2409.01907v1].\n* Agent-based simulation, as discussed in the paper \"How game complexity affects the playing behavior of synthetic agents\" [1807.02648v1].\n* Cybersecurity frameworks, as mentioned in the paper \"A cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework\" [2510.01751v1].\n\n**Open Challenges**\nThe gaps and future directions in agentic AI adaptation include:\n* Building trustworthy AI systems, as discussed in the paper \"Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance\" [2511.16402v1].\n* Developing more efficient and effective adaptation strategies, as mentioned in the paper \"A New Strategy for the Exploration of Venus\" [2412.06830v1].\n* Improving the reliability and generalization of agentic AI systems, as discussed in the paper \"Architectures for Building Agentic AI\" [2512.09458v1].\n\n**Key Papers**\nThe most important papers with brief descriptions are:\n* \"A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication\" [2203.08975v2]: This paper discusses the importance of communication in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and proposes a framework for agent adaptations.\n* \"A cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework\" [2510.01751v1]: This paper proposes a systematic framework for adaptation in agentic AI, including a cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework.\n* \"Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance\" [2511.16402v1]: This paper discusses the importance of building trustworthy AI systems and proposes a framework for trustworthy agentic workflows.\n* \"POLARIS: Typed Planning and Governed Execution for Agentic AI in Back-Office Automation\" [2601.11816v1]: This paper proposes a governed orchestration framework for agentic AI in back-office automation.\n* \"Architectures for Building Agentic AI\" [2512.09458v1]: This paper discusses the importance of architectures in building reliable agentic AI systems and proposes a framework for principled componentisation.",

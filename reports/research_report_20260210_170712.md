**Overview**
The paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for adaptation in agentic AI, which is a crucial mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization in AI systems. The authors propose a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations, providing a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for building more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

**Key Findings**
The key findings from the papers can be summarized as follows:
* Agent adaptations can be categorized into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms, as discussed in the paper "A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication" [2203.08975v2].
* Tool adaptations can be categorized into agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms, as mentioned in the paper "AIRCC-Clim: a user-friendly tool for generating regional probabilistic climate change scenarios and risk measures" [2111.01762v1].
* A systematic framework for adaptation in agentic AI is proposed, which includes a cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework, as discussed in the paper "A cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework" [2510.01751v1].
* The strengths and limitations of different adaptation strategies are discussed, including the exploration of Venus, as mentioned in the paper "A New Strategy for the Exploration of Venus" [2412.06830v1].
* The key open challenges and future opportunities in agentic AI adaptation include building trustworthy AI systems, as discussed in the paper "Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance" [2511.16402v1].

**Methodology Trends**
The common approaches and techniques used in the papers include:
* Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, as discussed in the paper "A Survey of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Communication" [2203.08975v2].
* Large language models, as mentioned in the paper "Focus Agent: LLM-Powered Virtual Focus Group" [2409.01907v1].
* Agent-based simulation, as discussed in the paper "How game complexity affects the playing behavior of synthetic agents" [1807.02648v1].
* Cybersecurity frameworks, as mentioned in the paper "A cybersecurity AI agent selection and decision support framework" [2510.01751v1].

**Open Challenges**
The gaps and future directions in agentic AI adaptation include:
* Building trustworthy AI systems, as discussed in the paper "Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance" [2511.16402v1].
* Developing more efficient and effective adaptation strategies, as mentioned in the paper "A New Strategy for the Exploration of Venus" [2412.06830v1].
